In Tibco EBX, mastering the **core objects** is crucial for effectively interacting with its data, metadata, and services. These objects represent the foundation of the EBX platform, enabling you to manage datasets, users, permissions, and workflows programmatically. Below is an overview of the core objects in EBX and their key functionalities:

---

## 1. **Repository**
   - **Description**: Represents the EBX repository as a whole. It's the entry point for accessing datasets, homes, and performing repository-wide operations.
   - **Key Methods**:
     - `Repository.getDefault()`: Returns the default repository instance.

   - **Key Methods**:
     - `DataSet.getTable(Path)`: Access a table within a dataset.
     - `Table.createIterator()`: Iterate through records in the table.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - Querying and manipulating tabular data.
     - Implementing business rules on table-level data.

---

## 5. **Record**
   - **Description**: Represents a single row within a table.
   - **Key Methods**:
     - `Record.getValue(Path)`: Retrieve a value for a specific field.
     - `Record.setValue(Path, Object)`: Update a value for a field.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - Reading and updating data row-by-row.
     - Validating or transforming individual rows of data.

---

## 6. **Path**
   - **Description**: Represents the path to an element in the EBX data model, such as a field or a table.
   - **Key Methods**:
     - `Path.parse(String)`: Parse a string into a path object.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - Navigating and identifying fields or tables programmatically.
     - Querying specific elements of the data model.

---

## 7. **Session**
   - **Description**: Represents the context of the current user interaction with EBX.
   - **Key Methods**:
     - `Session.getUserReference()`: Access information about the logged-in user.
     - `Session.isUserInRole(String)`: Check if the user has a specific role.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - Customizing behavior based on the user's identity or roles.
     - Ensuring security and role-based access control.

---

## 8. **Adaptation**
   - **Description**: Represents an in-memory view of a dataset, home, or table. Often used for transactional or temporary manipulations.
   - **Key Methods**:
     - `Adaptation.getTable(Path)`: Access a table within the adaptation.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - Querying or manipulating data temporarily without committing changes.
     - Accessing subsets of data during operations.

---

## 9. **UserReference**
   - **Description**: Represents the user interacting with the EBX system during a session.
   - **Key Methods**:
     - `UserReference.getUserName()`: Retrieve the username of the current user.
     - `UserReference.getRoles()`: Retrieve roles assigned to the user.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - Accessing user-specific details for custom services or scripts.
     - Implementing security logic based on user roles.

---

## 10. **ProcedureContext**
   - **Description**: Represents the context in which a procedure is executed, such as workflows or scheduled jobs.
   - **Key Methods**:
     - `ProcedureContext.getSession()`: Access the current session.
     - `ProcedureContext.doModifyContent()`: Modify content during a procedure.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - Automating data updates through scripts.
     - Executing custom logic within workflows.

---

## 11. **TableIterator**
   - **Description**: Provides a way to iterate over records in a table.
   - **Key Methods**:
     - `Table.createIterator()`: Create an iterator for a table.
     - `iterator.hasNext()`: Check if there are more records.
     - `iterator.next()`: Retrieve the next record.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - Reading or processing all rows in a table.
     - Batch processing or transformations.

---

## 12. **SessionInteraction**
   - **Description**: Represents an interactive session for user-driven actions in the UI or API.
   - **Key Methods**:
     - `SessionInteraction.askUserForInput()`: Prompt a user for input.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - Managing user interactions within a service.
     - Implementing dynamic user-driven workflows.
